# Extracting Semantic Information from Location Data

### Introduction
Current data mining methods allow for extraction of patterns from Location data, however these methods do not capture semantic information associated with the location data. Semantic information extraction involves extracting the type of place and time spent there. This information can hence, enhance the pattern recognition. However it is nearly impossible to capture these details especially in an Indian setting. The proposed solution aims to identify some high-level semantic tags like Home, Work, Park, Shopping_mall, Hospital, University and School.

### Algorithm / Pseudo-code
Refer [pseudo-code.txt](https://github.com/yashkotadia/Extracting-Semantic-Information-from-Location-Data/blob/master/Pseudo-code.txt)

### Dataset
Ideally the proposed solution should work for any Indian setting. You can test it out against your own dataset. You can download your own location data via Google Takeout. Note: The solution requires a good amount of data to work properly.

### Implement
[Raw_to_tag](https://github.com/yashkotadia/Extracting-Semantic-Information-from-Location-Data/blob/master/Raw_to_tag.ipynb) has the code.
